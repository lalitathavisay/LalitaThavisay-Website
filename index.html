        Enter bio here<br><br>
My name is Lalita Thavisay. I am currently in my first year studying at the University of California, Riverside. My major is declared as Language and Literatures with focuses on Spanish and Japanese. I've always had a fascination in polyglots and how their brains work. I would research polyglots in hopes of replicating them. Going to college and committing to learning foreign languages was the best option with the greatest outcome. I chose UCR specifically not only because it was a reasonable driving distance from my home, but because it emphasized its goal to spread diversity.
I was born in Anaheim, California into a Laotian family. My family of 4 lived with my mother‚Äôs family making the household a total of 10 people. Even though my grandparents did not speak English, my parents never truly enforced my brother and I to speak Lao. As a result, my brother and I now do not understand or speak Lao. I grew up in an area where the majority of parents spoke Vietnamese, so their kids spoke a second language. I always admired watching my friends talk to their parents in Vietnamese as it was like their own special way of bonding. A few years later, I moved out of my predominantly Asian community into Riverside County where most people spoke Spanish as a second language. It was a sudden culture shock especially being the only Asian in my grade. I was open to a new culture that I had not been exposed to before. I was very scared to share my own culture. When I finally established a solid group of friends, I started learning deep into the culture and answered their curiosities about mine. This has shaped me to this day and is one of the earliest inspirations as to why I want to learn languages. 
In high school, I tried many activities in STEAM. I have had past experiences in Tshirt tech. I used to be a part of a Tshirt printing group in high school. As team leader, I handled customer requests, ensuring a customer-satisfied design, proofing, overseeing, producing, payment, and delivery. This opened some great opportunities for me. In one case, Riverside County was holding a computer coding competition and selected my decision specifically. From there I handled an order of about 200 Tshirts. My experience when the print tech group taught me many skills. I was forced to take control without hesitation because we were dealing with deadlines, money, and quality. I was pushed creatively trying to fulfill all the criteria from the customer‚Äôs design request. 
Additionally, I joined the engineering program. This program helped develop many skills. I learned how to 3D design, program robotics, lasercut, and prototype design. All projects applied critical thinking in order to solve a given ‚Äúworld-application‚Äù problem. I was given great opportunities through this program such as given a tour to local middle school students demonstrating all the projects they can participate in. I got interviewed by the Press Enterprise about the program. Most memorably, I got to take part in giving our local assembly member and congressman. Everything I‚Äôve experienced has shaped me in some way and will continue to help me in the future.
